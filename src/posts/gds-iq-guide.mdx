Why Death’s Shadow? There are so many broken things to be doing in modern right
now. Between making infinite thopters, Jeskai Ascendancy Emry and turn 2 Primeval
Titans why is a fair deck like this the place to be?
Well Death’s Shadow decks have a big advantage over other fair decks. They get
to kill people. It sounds stupid but it’s very true. Death’s shadow decks at their core are
very proactive and aggressive. So now the question comes up, why should you play
Grixis Shadow instead of Mardu or Traverse variants? Well this answer comes in a
variety of reasons but let’s start from the beginning. First of all, Stubborn Denial. This is
the main draw to Grixis over other archetypes. In the format where the best deck is
trying to cast a 4 drop spell, Stubborn Denial is a good place to be. Finally, being in blue
offers very good sideboard options such as Disdainful Stroke and Tale’s End. These are
cards that are very well positioned against all the Urza and big mana in the format right
now. Finally there’s the fact that Grixis has the most tools for the Urza matchups.
Stubborn Denial is very good against both versions of the Urza deck.
So what about all the new cards? Between MH1 and ELD giving new cards to
almost every deck, GDS must have gotten something right? Well.....

## What makes this list different?

So this may look like a very stock GDS list but there are some very important things to
point out. First of all, the cantrip split.

**4 Bauble, 4 Scour, 1 Visions:**

The cantrip split in GDS is something that a lot of
people argue about, I think this is the correct one. GDS is a hyper efficient turbo xerox
disruptive aggro deck. You want to be using your mana efficiently for every turn of the
game. Bauble plays very well into this plan allowing u to cast a discard spell on turn 1
and still find a threat for example. Thought scour is the most important cantrip after that.
We are a snapcaster mage gurmag angler deck so it is very important the graveyard is
full at all times. We play exactly 1 serum visions because it’s good in certain matchups/
to snap back after milling over it against control/midrange decks.

**1 Kolaghan's Command Main:** ​ This is one of the most important cards in the main
deck right now. With Urza strategies being some of the best decks having a main deck
answer to artifacts and random ensnaring bridges is crucial. The other main pull for
K-command main is the fact that Stoneforge Nystic is now legal. K-Command is very
important for blowing up swords because the most common ones people play give
protection from black, something we are not equipped to deal with.
**1 Drown in the loch:** ​This is a very interesting card. I had to cut a one mana removal
spell in the form of lightning bolt for it, but I think it’s worth it. This card most of the time
is literally terminate and counterspell stapled together. The card is very very powerful **Most** ​ of the time. That is one of the reasons we are only able to play 1 copy. There are
some matchups (Tron) where the card doesn’t do anything. The other reason is it’s 2
mana in our main deck. It can be seriously clunky in multiples.


## Sideboard Cards

```c
2 Collective Brutality
2 Disdainful Stroke
1 Tale's End
2 Kolaghan's Command
2 Plague Engineer
1 Spell Snare
1 Duress
1 The Royal Scions
1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor
1 Terminate
1 Abrade
```

This sideboard at first glance looks like a pile. These cards are all very good and offer
meaningful things to our deck however, and I'm going to explain why.

**2 Collective Brutality:** ​ These have been a staple of the shadow sideboard for a long
time. The Card is very versatile getting to come in against burn, creature decks, and
control decks. Well the effect isn’t amazing in any of those matchups the fact it’s 2 slots
for so many matchups makes it very worth it.
**2 Disdainful Stroke:** ​ Another card that has been in our sideboards forever. This card is
just needed. It’s very good against Tron, Urza, Titan decks and passable against other
things. Just having a hard counter for these matchups is very important and I don’t see
this card going anywhere.

**1 Tale’s End:** ​ This is the spiciest inclusion in my deck by far but I think it earns its slot.
This slot was previously the 3rd stroke but I think tale’s end is better for a number of
reasons. First, it counters all the cards that matter out of the Urza deck, planeswalkers,
Sai and Urza. This in itself is a huge plus for the card. Secondly, it’s a stifle effect for blast
zone and EE. We don’t have any other card that checks blast zone, and this card is
already good enough in blast zone/EE matchups. Finally, Tron. This card is incredible
against Tron. It counters nearly all their threats as well as stifling map, o stone and blast
zone activations.

**2 Kolaghan's Command:** ​ This is another very stock inclusion. Being a 2/1 in the fair
matchups, destroying problematic artifacts, and being an extra removal spell for
creature matchups makes this card a powerful sideboard option.


**2 Plague Engineer:** ​One of the only cards we got out of MH1, but a very important one.
This card is good against the Urza decks, tribal decks, and other random tokens decks.
This is one of the most versatile cards in our sideboard and a big new addition.

**1 Spell Snare:** ​ I think spell snare is presently in the best place it’s ever been in the
modern format. There’s Thopter Foundry, Wrenn and Six, Stoneforge Mystic, Chalice of
the void and the list goes on. This is a very good card in a lot of matchups and the best
possible thing you can be doing turn 1 on the draw a lot of the time.

**1 Duress** ​: A card that I’ve recently added to my sideboard and been very happy with.
It’s just the 7th discard spell. It doesn’t seem special but we really want an extra discard
spell against all the combo and control decks running around right now, and it’s better
than iok number 3.

**1 The Royal Scions:** ​This is a card a lot of people don’t like very much but I’m very high
on it. This card is absurd against fair decks. The main reason I see people say the card
is bad is because it doesn’t generate real card advantage. While this is technically true,
drawing a card and discarding a dead fetchland is basically just drawing a card. This on
it’s own is not good enough however, it does a lot of other things. It makes your
snapcaster mages real threats by turning them into 4/1 first strikers and it ultimates very
quickly.

**1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor:** ​This is a card that is very controversial in the shadow
sideboard. Some people think it’s insane to play a 4 drop in your 17 land deck, and
others swear by it. I land somewhere in the middle on this card. I think right now
however it is a very good choice Yes, it is hard to cast a 4 drop, but with the amount of
cantrips and lack of card selection we have it’s very possible to hit 4 lands. However it’s
one the best possible cards to have in your deck against control, Jund and other
midrange piles and that’s why it earns a slot.
**1 Terminate:** ​There’s not a ton to say about this card. It’s just a 2 mana unconditional
removal spell for any creature. People love to put reality smasher and other big
creatures that fatal push doesn’t answer in their deck so it’s useful to have a card like
this.


**1 Abrade:** ​ Another card that is in our deck for versatility. This card is just fine in
creature matchups and fine against artifacts decks. Where it really shines however is
against Aether Vial decks. This card lets us hard punish greedy 1 land vial hands, while
still functioning when the opponent doesn’t draw a vial.
